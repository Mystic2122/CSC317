This was my first time using JavaScript other than the switcher from asignment 2. I'm a statistics major so In the future there are way more functions that I've already coded in R and Python that would be really cool to implement in JavaScript and make my calculator even better! This calculator is pretty basic. I did use the `eval()` function for basic operations, so in the future maybe I could implement the basic functions without JavaScript's built in `eval()` funciton. The only other function I implemented so far is a function that calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. To use the function, type 2 numbers seperated by a comma and the click the GCD button e.g 121,55 --> GCD --> 11. 
I had some trouble with the adaptive layout. I feel like CSS is so hard.
