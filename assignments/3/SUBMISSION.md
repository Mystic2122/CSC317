# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Group Analysis (250-500 words)
[Write a collaborative analysis comparing the different approaches. Each member should contribute to this section.]
**Daniel's Approach:** 
When approaching the Hand-written style I had wanted a clean style and as I often used GNOME Desktop Environment
I had reccomended that we use the libadwaita style for designing the Portfollio site. In addition my approach involved
trying to not mess with the main index.html unless it involved adding classes to make it easier to organize and code
the CSS Style. I had also approached it with the idea that we should use a dark theme.

**Quynh's Approach:** 

**Nicholas' Approach:** 
I needed to figure out how to implement the switcher.js file because I've never worked with JavaScript before. It was actually simpler than I thought, just getting all the style sheets from the styles/ directory was a little confusing at first. For the AI 2 style I wanted a darker theme with some cool hover animations. For the hybrid.css I just took the sections from each style sheet that I liked the most and thought fit well together. For example, I liked the link style for the github and LinkedIn links at the bottom of the page from AI-style-3.

## Individual Reflections

### Daniel Jose Dacumos - Hand-written CSS
[Individual reflection on lessons learned and contribution to hand-written CSS]
When working on the Hand-written CSS, while I had been the primary programmer behind the Hand-written CSS.
As for me reflecting on this assignment I had definitely had to refresh some of my knowledge regarding the animations 
and flex boxes, but I was able to quickly remember through looking the examples given by the professor. 
Throughout it helped show me the importance of classes and ids as it had made it a lot easier to organize my CSS file.

## Group Preferred Version
[Explain which version the group prefers and why - this should be a consensus decision]

## Collaboration Experience
[Describe how the group worked together, challenges faced, and lessons learned about teamwork]
When looking that how the group worked together I would  definitely say that we all had to come to a 
consensus how we wanted the design to turn out. As we heavily communicated how the design throughout 
the process in a call. As even for the Hand-written CSS we had a challenge with how we should do the CSS
and decided that one of us would be responsible for coding it, but we would be in call discussing how it
should look and giving our opinions while one of us coded it in. The challenges faced was the often or not
we couldn't find a time to meet, but the days we were able to meet we were able to get the job done.
Overall, the main lessons that we learned about teamwork is that it would've been better if we had organized
it from the very beginning and were able to have more meeting more often.
