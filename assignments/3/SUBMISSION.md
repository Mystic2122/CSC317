# Portfolio Styling Assignment Analysis

## Group Analysis (250-500 words)
[Write a collaborative analysis comparing the different approaches. Each member should contribute to this section.]
**Daniel's Approach:** 
When approaching the Hand-written style I had wanted a clean style and as I often used GNOME Desktop Environment
I had reccomended that we use the libadwaita style for designing the Portfollio site. In addition my approach involved
trying to not mess with the main index.html unless it involved adding classes to make it easier to organize and code
the CSS Style. I had also approached it with the idea that we should use a dark theme.

**Quynh's Approach:** 
For my version of the portfolio, I wanted to build on our class examples by keeping the layout simple, readable, and easy to navigate.
I worked on organizing the HTML so that each section — About, Skills, Projects, and Contact was clearly separated and consistent with the class structure. 
My goal was to make the page look clean and professional while still matching the format we agreed on.

**Nicholas's Approach:** 
I needed to figure out how to implement the switcher.js file because I've never worked with JavaScript before. It was actually simpler than I thought, just getting all the style sheets from the styles/ directory was a little confusing at first. For the AI 2 style I wanted a darker theme with some cool hover animations. For the hybrid.css I just took the sections from each style sheet that I liked the most and thought fit well together. For example, I liked the link style for the github and LinkedIn links at the bottom of the page from AI-style-3. 

## Individual Reflections

### Daniel Jose Dacumos - Hand-written CSS and AI Text Prompt CSS
[Individual reflection on lessons learned and contribution to hand-written CSS]
When working on the Hand-written CSS, while I had been the primary programmer behind the Hand-written CSS.
As for me reflecting on this assignment I had definitely had to refresh some of my knowledge regarding the animations 
and flex boxes, but I was able to quickly remember through looking the examples given by the professor. 
Throughout it helped show me the importance of classes and ids as it had made it a lot easier to organize my CSS file.

For the AI text prompt working on mine it took some time as I had to restart the entire chat log twice to get it to
start to look good. As originally, it gave a black and yellow appearance and was very unappealing. However, with the 
second attempt I was a lot more specific in how I wanted it to look and then with just one prompt it was able to make it 
look nicely. However, the reason why I think it came out nice with one prompt after resetting it was that I had to specify
a lot of stuff that only someone who knows CSS would be able to tell it to do.

### [Nicholas Wendt] - AI Text Prompt CSS and Hybrid CSS
[Individual reflection on AI prompting experience and lessons learned]
Working on ai-2.css this needed to figure out how to get the ai to do what I had wanted to. For AI 2 style I had wanted to make sure that it got the dark theme
correct and that it looked nice. Reflecting on it I believe that the ai had gotten what I had wanted it to do. With it coming out very clean and I liked how it 
looked. For example, looking at the Hybrid I was able to make it look good with some help from Quynh Dinh we were able to get the Hybrid to look nicely with Daniel 
giving advice on the appearance as for the Hand-written he was responsible for writing it and then for the Hybrid we were responsible for it, but was there
to help us out with it.

### [Quynh Dinh] - AI Text Prompt CSS and Hybrid CSS
[Individual reflection on AI prompting experience and lessons learned]
I worked with the third AI CSS prompt (ai-3.css) that focused on a clean, modern design. The AI did a good job setting up the base style, especially with spacing and color choices, but I still had to adjust things like text size, alignment, and contrast to make it look right. 

Using the AI prompt was actually really helpful. 
It gave me a good starting point and some ideas I wouldn’t have thought of right away. But it also made me realize that AI can’t fully replace the creative part of web design. You still have to understand what looks good and make adjustments by hand.
Overall, I liked working with the AI version because it saved time and helped me practice editing and improving automatically generated code.

I had also worked with setting up the Hybrid.css as I helped with the code but we had a bit of difficulty with using the branches and shared code on discord to make it easier
for the two of us while in the call to code on the same document. While Daniel helped with appearance advice. It made me realize that we definitely still need some 
adjustments made by people.

## Group Preferred Version
[Explain which version the group prefers and why - this should be a consensus decision]
When loooking at the version the group prefers we chose is the Hybrid as it's the best of both worlds as we're able to combine our knowledge from working
on the Hand-written CSS and combine it with the parts that we liked from the Ai styles. For example, we really liked the color pallette from ai-style 2, but
we also like the appearance of how the github and Linkedlin links looked like from style 3. With the projects from Hand-written CSS and it's boxes. Using this
we were able to much easily create a hybrid.css that looked both appealing, but wasn't just a dark style with only bland colors from Hand-written CSS.

## Collaboration Experience
[Describe how the group worked together, challenges faced, and lessons learned about teamwork]
When looking that how the group worked together I would  definitely say that we all had to come to a 
consensus how we wanted the design to turn out. As we heavily communicated how the design throughout 
the process in a call. As even for the Hand-written CSS we had a challenge with how we should do the CSS
and decided that one of us would be responsible for coding it, but we would be in call discussing how it
should look and giving our opinions while one of us coded it in. The challenges faced was the often or not
we couldn't find a time to meet, but the days we were able to meet we were able to get the job done.
Overall, the main lessons that we learned about teamwork is that it would've been better if we had organized
it from the very beginning and were able to have more meeting more often.
