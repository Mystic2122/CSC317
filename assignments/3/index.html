    <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p id="about-content">
            Hi I'm Nick. I'm in my final year at San Francisco State University studying statistics, computer science, and economics. 
            After I complete my degree I want to use the skills I've gained to work with data, designing databases, and making data easier to visualize and digest. 
            In addition to statistics, I have a deep interest in algorithms. I enjoy analyzing time complexity and understanding how efficient algorithms can be applied to real-world problems.
            Currently I'm planning on applying to graduate school for programs in statistics and data science. 
            Achieving a masters degree in this area will give me more tools with which I manipulate and analyze data and time to become more comfortable with the tools and material I already know.
            <br><br>
            My dream job is to become a sports analyst. But being a Database Architect or Administrator would be pretty cool.
            <br><br>
            When I'm not coding or doing math, I like playing and watching sports, and I like to cook.
