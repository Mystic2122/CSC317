Daniel Jose Dacumos's Contributions:
- Implemented the Frontend that was used through the site for nearly every page
- This includes making it so that the Movies properly Fit with their Movie Cards and Covers
- Worked on the Animations for the Movie Cards, to indicate which Movie the user was on.
- Responsible for setting up Routes for the Movie Page (Originally it was seperate), but we changed it so that it replaces the Home Page unless the Title is Clicked.
- Helped plan out certain aspects of the Project such as CRUD and how the Movies should work what is expected of us.
